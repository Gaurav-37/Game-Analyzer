## Troubleshooting

### **Build Issues**

#### "g++ not found"
- Install GCC/G++ compiler (Cygwin, MinGW, or Visual Studio)
- Make sure it's in your PATH

#### "ImGui not found"
- Run `setup_dependencies.bat` first
- Check internet connection for downloading dependencies

### **Runtime Issues**

#### "Access Denied" when reading memory
- Run as Administrator for best results
- Some processes may be protected by Windows security
- Try selecting a different process

#### Process not showing in list
- Click "Refresh Processes" to update the list
- Toggle "Show System Processes" if needed
- Use the search bar to find specific applications

#### Memory scanning shows no results
- Ensure the selected process is actually running
- Try "Scan Game Data" for more targeted results
- Some processes may have limited readable memory regions

#### "Please select a process first" error
- Make sure you've clicked on a process in the list
- Try double-clicking the process for quick selection
- Check that the process is still running

#### Changed values not detected
- Make sure you clicked "Compare Values" first
- Ensure you're actually changing values in the game/application
- Try scanning for different types of game data

### **Performance Tips**
- Use "Scan Game Data" instead of "Scan Process Memory" for faster results
