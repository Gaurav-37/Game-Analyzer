## Usage

### Basic Workflow

#### 1. **Select a Process**
- Launch the application
- Use the search bar to find specific applications
- Click on a process to select it or double-click for quick selection
- The status bar will show your selection

#### 2. **Discover Memory Addresses**
- Click **"Scan Process Memory"** for general memory scanning
- Click **"Scan Game Data"** for targeted game variable detection
- Wait for the scan to complete (progress bar shows status)
- Review discovered addresses in the list

#### 3. **Find Changing Values**
- Click **"Compare Values"** to capture current memory state
- Play your game or interact with the application
- Click **"Show Changed Values"** to see what changed
- Changed addresses are automatically added to monitoring

#### 4. **Select Addresses to Monitor**
- Use checkboxes to select addresses from the discovered list
- Click **"Add Selected Addresses"** to add them to monitoring
- Use the search box to filter addresses by value or type

#### 5. **Monitor and Export**
- Click **"Start Monitoring"** to begin real-time tracking
- Watch values update in the monitored addresses list
- Click **"Export Data"** to save results to CSV

### Advanced Features

#### **Game Profiles**
- Click **"Save Game Profile"** to save current addresses for the selected game
- Click **"Load Game Profile"** to reload saved addresses
- Profiles are automatically named based on the process name

#### **Search and Filter**
- **Process Search**: Type in the process search box to filter running applications
- **Address Search**: Type in the address search box to filter discovered addresses
- **System Processes**: Toggle "Show System Processes" to include/exclude system processes

#### **Memory Analysis**
- **Value Interpretation**: Addresses show interpreted values (e.g., "Possible: Health/Score/Count")
- **Memory Regions**: Information about memory protection and state
- **Data Types**: Automatic detection of integers, floats, and ASCII strings

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C++17 with Windows API integration
- **GUI Framework**: Native Win32 API with custom controls
- **Memory Reading**: Windows API (`ReadProcessMemory`, `VirtualQueryEx`)
- **Process Enumeration**: Windows API (`EnumProcesses`, `GetModuleBaseName`)
- **Memory Scanning**: Advanced region enumeration and value sampling
- **Threading**: Multi-threaded scanning and monitoring operations
- **Build System**: GCC/G++ with static linking for portability

## Troubleshooting

### **Build Issues**

#### "g++ not found"
- Install GCC/G++ compiler (Cygwin, MinGW, or Visual Studio)
- Make sure it's in your PATH

#### "ImGui not found"
- Run `setup_dependencies.bat` first
- Check internet connection for downloading dependencies

### **Runtime Issues**

#### "Access Denied" when reading memory
- Run as Administrator for best results
- Some processes may be protected by Windows security
- Try selecting a different process

#### Process not showing in list
- Click "Refresh Processes" to update the list
- Toggle "Show System Processes" if needed
- Use the search bar to find specific applications

#### Memory scanning shows no results
- Ensure the selected process is actually running
- Try "Scan Game Data" for more targeted results
- Some processes may have limited readable memory regions

#### "Please select a process first" error
- Make sure you've clicked on a process in the list
- Try double-clicking the process for quick selection
- Check that the process is still running

#### Changed values not detected
- Make sure you clicked "Compare Values" first
- Ensure you're actually changing values in the game/application
- Try scanning for different types of game data

### **Performance Tips**
- Use "Scan Game Data" instead of "Scan Process Memory" for faster results
- Save game profiles to avoid re-scanning
- Filter addresses using the search box for better performance
